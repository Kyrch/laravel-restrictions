## Description

Laravel Prohibitions is a Laravel package that allows you to prohibit users from executing specific actions for a determined period of time.

Instead of relying on hard-coded checks or ad-hoc flags, this package introduces a sanction-based system where actions can be explicitly denied through well-defined rules.

The package also provides a Sanction model, which works as a preset of prohibited actions, making it easy to group multiple prohibitions under a single disciplinary rule — such as temporary bans, feature restrictions, or full account suspensions.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require kyrch/laravel-prohibitions
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-prohibitions-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-prohibitions-config"
```

### Usage

#### Setup

Add the `HasSanctions` trait to your User model:

```php
use Kyrch\Prohibition\Traits\HasSanctions;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasSanctions;
}
```

You need to create your sanctions and prohibitions first. For example:

```php
$prohibition = Prohibition::query()->create(['name' => 'update post']);

$sanction = Sanction::query()->create(['name' => 'posts']);

$prohibition->sanctions()->attach($sanction);
```

#### How to prohibit

Now you can use methods this packages provides, such as:

```php
# Prohibit the user from updating any posts.
$user->prohibit('update post', now()->addWeek());

# Similar to roles, you can create a kind of "ban preset" that has a group of prohibitions.
$user->applySanction('posts', now()->addWeek());

# Check if user is prohibited from updating any post.
$user->isProhibitedFrom('update post');
```

It is recommended to use the `isProhibitedFrom()` method in your `Gate::before` or
the `before` method in your policy class.

#### Events

There are two events: `ModelProhibitionTriggered` and `ModelSanctionTriggered`.
If you don't want them enabled, you can disable it in the published config file.
